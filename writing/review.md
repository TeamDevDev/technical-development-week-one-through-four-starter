## Technical Assessment

### Summary Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each technical development task that you completed:

- [] Installed and correctly configured Quarto on your laptop
- [] Created and maintained a Quarto-based web site that is deployed to Netlify
- [] Wrote a total of three articles about technical development
- [] Created a GitHub issue on your partner's web site for three technical development précis articles

- [] Installed a complete Python-based development environment for Fuzzing Book and/or Debugging Book
- [] Installed all of the Fuzzing Book and/or Debugging Book dependencies
- [] Ran a local Jupyter Lab server to access the materials in Fuzzing Book and/or Debugging Book
- [] Executed all of the source code segments in each assigned chapter of Fuzzing Book and/or Debugging Book
- [] Participated in the class discussions about technical development
- [] Completed all of the documentation and reflection tasks in this document

TODO: Do not check a box if you did not complete a specific technical development task!

### Learning Objectives

TODO: Please refer to the Learning Objectives section of the course web site to review
the learning objectives for both Allegheny College and the Software Engineering course.

#### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the during this module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge

TODO: When you are writing your response to this question, please follow this template:

When I was working on `fill in the name of a technical development task`, I
made a mistake when I `explain details about the mistake`.

I did not understand `explain what you did not understand`.

Now I know `explain what you know`.

I revealed the gap in my understanding by `explain what steps you took to
identify the gap`.

Now I know `explain what you now know`.

To demonstrate my improved understanding of this technical skill, I will
`explain what steps you will take now that you understand the learning
objective`.

#### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated technical skill.

TODO: Provide a direct link to course web site section that describes the learning
objective so that it is clear you have read this section of the syllabus and
then correctly described the learning objective in your own writing.

#### Give a reference to the location of the course web site that contains the learning objectives

TODO: Provide the web reference

### Technical Development Précis

TODO: Use the following list to provide a URL for the three technical development
précis articles that you wrote as a part of this module:

- I Wrote Article 1 URL:
- I Wrote Article 2 URL:
- I Wrote Article 3 URL:

TODO: Use the following list to provide a URL for the issue tracker entries that you
provided for the three technical development précis articles that your
partners wrote during this module:

- I Reviewed Article 1 URL:
- I Reviewed Article 2 URL:
- I Reviewed Article 3 URL:

### Executive Summaries

TODO: Use the following list to provide the URL of an article that you helped to
publish on the Developer Development web site. Please note that it is not
expected that you absolutely must provide a reference to three articles. With
that said, it is expected that every student in the course will make a
contribution to at least one article during every four-week module.

- I Contributed to Article 1 URL:
- I Contributed to Article 2 URL:
- I Contributed to Article 3 URL:

TODO: How many commits did you make to the Developer Development web site during this
module? Please note that commits only count if they appear in the final listing
of commits for the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/TeamDevDev/www.developerdevelopment.com

I make `X` commits to the Developer Development web site during this module.

## Technical Content

### Fuzzing Book or Debugging Book

#### Jupyter Server Execution

TODO: Provide output in a fenced code block to illustrate that the Jupyter Lab server runs on your laptop

#### Using Jupyter Notebooks

TODO: Provide a one or two sentence description of the steps that you take to execute
the Jupyter notebooks inside of either Fuzzing Book or Debugging Book.

TODO: Provide a reference to a PNG graphic file that contains a screenshot showing
that you are running the source code in Fuzzing Book or Debugging Book through a
Jupyter Lab server running on your laptop.

TODO: Your reference to the image must follow this format:

<!-- ![<The alternate label "Jupyter Screenshot">](<path to the file called jupyter_screenshot.png>) -->

NOTE: Please make sure that the image reference is not included in a comment like you
see in the above example that illustrates how to make the reference.

#### Source Code Segment

TODO: Pick one example of a source code segment found in a reading assignment from
either Fuzzing Book or Debugging Book and explain how it works. Your response to
this question should furnish an input to a Python function, the output of the
Python function when provided with the input, and the source code of the Python
function itself. Your response to this question should also walk through the
lines of the source code in detail, demonstrating your understanding of all the
technical software engineering details that this source code was used to
explain. Your response to this question must contain a fenced code block with
the Python source code that found in either Fuzzing Book or Debugging Book.
